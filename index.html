          <h2>A New Leader for a Changing City</h2>

          <h2>Meet Matt</h2>
          <p>Matt Watkajtys is a former technology executive. His entire career he worked with products that started as a vision.
            <br>He has helped usher those visions to execution.</p>
          <p>Matt made a decision to run for city council to fight for the urban core. This district has been ignored for far too long.</p>
          <p>Matt has been a renter in the Golden Triangle for six years after leaving Battery Park City in New York City.</p>

          <p>All was well until COVID.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>There were pay decreases and interruptions, personal savings dwindled, and Matt found himself working at an Amazon Fulfillment Center.</p>
          <p>The next year COVID took its toll and months were lost. He found himself on Emergency Rent Relief. The situation grew dire.</p>
          <p>COVID changed the world, lives were upended, cities were stressed to the breaking point and yet there is a determination to overcome.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>An open letter to District 10.</h2>
        <p>The challenges of the past few years have presented us with an unprecedented opportunity to shape Denver's future in a post-pandemic world.</p>
        <p>I entered this race because I was worried for our future. The future for our families, our renters, our small businesses, and our economic engine.</p>
        <p>My life changed during covid. I became "housing insecure" for the first time in my life. Emergency Rent Relief saved me.</p>
        <p>COVID wasn't kind to me. It wasn't kind to many of us.</p>
        <p> We have all a favorite small businesses close, we know too many neighbors forced to move, and too many friends lost to the battles of mental illness and addiction.</p>
        <p>We have fought against a changing climate and those battles have been difficult and at times, devastating. We have seen neighborhoods consumed by flames, homes washed away by floodwaters, and our citizens trapped by snow</p>
        <p>Our challenges are not unique to Denver. As a region we have endured extreme heat and struggled to adapt to a new normal.</p>

        <p> But we are not alone in this fight. We must come together, put aside our differences and work towards a common goal of protecting our shared home.</p>
           <p> It's time for action and we all have a part to play. Together, we can build a Denver that is stronger, more equitable, and more resilient than ever before.</p>
        <p>I hope to be a part of this effort to make Denver a better place for everyone</p>
